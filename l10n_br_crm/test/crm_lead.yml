  In order to test the conversion of a lead into a opportunity,
-
  I set lead to open stage.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |

  I check if the lead stage is "Open".
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_company, string: Lead stage is Open}:
     - stage_id.sequence == 1
-
  I convert lead into opportunity for exiting customer.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.convert_opportunity(cr, uid ,[ref("crm_lead_company")], ref("base.res_partner_2"))
-
  I check details of converted opportunity.
